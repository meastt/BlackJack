## What is Card Counting?

Card counting is a legal blackjack strategy that allows players to track the ratio of high to low cards remaining in the deck. It is NOT cheating - it's a mental skill that uses probability and memory to gain a mathematical edge over the casino.

### How Card Counting Works

1. **Assign Values:** Each card is assigned a point value (varies by system)
2. **Keep Running Count:** Add/subtract as cards are dealt
3. **Calculate True Count:** Divide running count by decks remaining
4. **Adjust Bets:** Bet more when count is positive (player advantage)

### Is Card Counting Legal?

Yes, card counting is completely legal in all jurisdictions. It uses only mental calculation - no devices or external aids. However, casinos are private businesses and may ask skilled counters to leave.

## Practice Drills

### True Count Conversion
**Target Skill:** Mental Math
**Pain Point:** Dividing running count by decks remaining instantly

The true count normalizes your running count for multi-deck games. Formula: True Count = Running Count ÷ Decks Remaining

**Practice:** https://protocol21blackjack.com/drills/blackjack-true-count-practice

### Deck Estimation
**Target Skill:** Visual Accuracy
**Pain Point:** Guessing how many decks are in the discard tray

Accurate deck estimation is critical for true count calculation. Goal: Accuracy within ±0.5 decks.

**Practice:** https://protocol21blackjack.com/drills/deck-estimation-drills

### Speed Counting
**Target Skill:** Reaction Time
**Pain Point:** Losing the count when the dealer speeds up

Casino dealers deal at 1-1.5 seconds per card. Training at faster speeds makes real play feel easier.
