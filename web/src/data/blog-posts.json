    "content": "Card counting is a blackjack strategy that allows players to track the ratio of high to low cards remaining in the deck. When the deck is rich in high cards (10s, face cards, and Aces), the player has an advantage. When it's rich in low cards, the house has an advantage.\n\n## The Basic Concept\n\nAt its core, card counting works by assigning point values to cards as they're dealt. In the popular Hi-Lo system:\n\n- Cards 2-6 = +1\n- Cards 7-9 = 0\n- Cards 10-A = -1\n\nAs cards are dealt, you keep a running count by adding or subtracting based on each card you see.\n\n## Why It Works\n\nBlackjack is unique among casino games because previous hands affect future outcomes. Unlike roulette where each spin is independent, in blackjack, cards that have been dealt cannot appear again until the deck is reshuffled.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe best way to learn card counting is through consistent practice. Protocol 21 offers dedicated drills to help you master the Hi-Lo system and other counting methods at casino speed."

    "content": "The Hi-Lo system is the most widely used card counting method in blackjack. Developed by Harvey Dubner in 1963 and later refined by Stanford Wong, it offers an excellent balance of simplicity and effectiveness.\n\n## Card Values\n\nIn Hi-Lo, every card is assigned a value:\n\n- **Low cards (2-6):** +1\n- **Neutral cards (7-9):** 0\n- **High cards (10, J, Q, K, A):** -1\n\n## Running Count vs. True Count\n\nThe running count is your cumulative total. But in multi-deck games, you need to calculate the true count by dividing your running count by the number of decks remaining.\n\n## Betting Strategy\n\nIncrease your bets when the true count is positive (+2 or higher) and decrease when it's negative. A positive count means the remaining deck is rich in 10s and Aces, giving you the edge."
