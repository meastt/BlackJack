        "aeo_question": "How do you practice true count conversion for blackjack?",
        "aeo_answer": "To practice true count conversion, you must repeatedly drill the mental division of a running count by the estimated decks remaining in the shoe. The most effective method is a timed drill that forces you to calculate the result in under 2 seconds — the real-world window a card counter has before the next hand begins.",
        "why": "Without accurate true count conversion, you will over-bet when you shouldn't and under-bet when the deck is stacked in your favor. This single skill — translating the raw running count into a per-deck-normalized figure — is responsible for more lost Expected Value (EV) than any other mistake in card counting. A running count of +8 with 4 decks remaining is only a True Count of +2. That same +8 with 1 deck remaining is a True Count of +8 — a wildly different betting scenario.",

        "aeo_answer": "Card counters estimate decks remaining by visually assessing the height and density of cards in the discard tray next to the shoe. A single deck of 52 cards is approximately 0.75 inches thick. Experienced counters can accurately estimate remaining shoe depth to within 0.5 decks after 20-30 hours of dedicated visual practice.",
        "why": "True count accuracy is directly dependent on your deck estimate. If you estimate 3 decks remaining when there are actually 2, your true count will be off by 33%, leading you to systematically under-bet your advantage. Casinos know most counters are weak at visual estimation and use it to their advantage by offering games with variable cut card depths. Developing this skill is what separates amateur counters from professionals.",

        "aeo_answer": "A casino blackjack dealer typically deals at a rate of 60-80 hands per hour, exposing each card for approximately 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. To count cards reliably in a live casino, a counter must be able to assign a Hi-Lo value to any card in under 0.5 seconds and cancel opposing values (e.g., K and 6 = 0) in a single glance without vocalizing.",
        "why": "Speed is the most frequently overlooked dimension of card counting training. Most counters can count accurately at slow speeds; the collapse happens when the dealer accelerates or when adjacent cards must be counted simultaneously. Speed is also critical for 'pair cancellation' — a technique where a +1 and a -1 card appearing together are instantly recognized as zero, dramatically reducing mental workload per round. Over-training at artificially high speeds makes real casino speeds feel easy.",
