Since the count is unbalanced, it drifts positive as the shoe progresses, naturally indicating when the deck is advantageous without any division. Counters who are comfortable with true count conversion may find Hi-Lo or Zen Count provide a higher long-run edge, but for players who want the simplest path to a positive EV, KO is the clear choice.",

        "aeo_answer": "Wong Halves is a Level 3 balanced counting system developed by Stanford Wong. It uses fractional card values: 2s and 7s count as +0.5, 3s, 4s, and 6s as +1, 5s as +1.5, 8s as 0, 9s as -0.5, and 10-value cards and Aces as -1. This granular value system maximizes both betting and playing efficiency, making it the theoretically most powerful counting system in practical use.",

Stanford Wong hypothesized that using fractional values to more precisely represent the probabilistic impact of each card on the remaining deck's favorability would produce a demonstrably superior betting and playing edge — and the math proved him right.",
        "vs_other": "Wong Halves achieves a near-perfect 0.99 Betting Correlation — essentially as good as any counting system can get. Its PE of 0.69 is the highest of any practical counting system. The cost is a staggeringly complex mental arithmetic process: players must seamlessly track fractional values like +0.5 and -0.5 in their running count while dealing, betting, and talking to a dealer. Most professional players use Hi-Lo exclusively and only study Wong Halves to understand the theoretical ceiling of advantage play.",
